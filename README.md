# Apple-Stock-Price-Prediction
Deep Learning Models:
Stock Price data is sequential in nature and as you know Recurrent Neural Networks have worked very well on Sequential Data. Hence, explore deep learning approaches like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for the data and compare the performance.
You have to perform the analysis on the closing price. We are expecting you to create deep learning models (SimpleRNN and LSTM) that can predict 1 day, 5 days and 10 days behaviour of stockâ€™s adjusted closing price.
This model aims to Basic Python, Data Visualization, Data Cleaning, EDA, Deep Learning (SimpleRNN and LSTM)
